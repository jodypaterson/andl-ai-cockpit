# andl-ai-cockpit

This repository will host the VS Code extension for the ANDL AI Cockpit.

- Status: initial bootstrap
- Language/stack: TBD (will mirror patterns from `andl-ai-config-extension` as needed)

## Getting started

- Add your extension scaffolding (package.json, src/extension.ts, build config) or ask Copilot to scaffold a minimal VS Code extension here.
